### Phase 10: Reflection
######Sample Question #6

JavaScript provides computational and structural reflection methods through a
built-in object called Reflect. Unfortunately this object is only supported by a couple browsers, including Firefox (Gecko) and Edge. Reflect is not supported by Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, or Safari. [[1]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect) Here is a short example of how one might use 2 out of the 14 methods provided by Reflect:

```js
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <script>
    
    var pet = {
                name: "Nelson",
                type: "dog",
                age: 3,
                color: "black"
            };

    //computational reflection
    document.write(Reflect.has(pet, "name")); //True
    document.write("<br>");
    
    //structural reflection
    document.write(Reflect.deleteProperty(pet, "name")); //True
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write(Reflect.has(pet, "name")); //False
    document.write("<br>");

  </script>
</html>

```

In a supported browser, this should print:

    true
    true
    false
