### Phase 6: Untyped vs Weakly vs Strongly Typed
######Sample Question #3

To determine whether JavaScript is untyped, weakly typed, or strongly typed I wrote the following code to test different operations:

```js
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <script>
    var x = 5;
    var y = "94";
    var s = "skjg";
    var b = true;
    document.write("var x = 5; var y = '94'; var s = 'skjg'; var b = true;");
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("TEST ADDING");
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("<br>");

    document.write("x + y = "+ x + y); //concat
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("x + s = "+ x + s); //concat
    document.write("<br>"); 
    document.write("x + b = "+x + b); //5 + true = 6
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("y + s = "+y + s); //concat
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("b + y = "+b + y); //concat
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("s + b = "+s + b); //concat
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("<br>");

    document.write("TEST MULTIPLYING");
    document.write("<br>");
    var a = x * y;
    document.write("a = x * y = 5 * '94' = " + a + " and type of a is " + typeof(a)); //number -> string -> number
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("x * s = "+x * s); //NO
    document.write("<br>"); 
    document.write("x * b = "+x * b); //5 * true = 5
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("y * s = "+y * s); //NO
    document.write("<br>");
    a = b * y;
    document.write("a = b * y = true * '94' = " + a + " and type of a is " + typeof(a)); //bool -> string -> number
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("s * b = "+s * b); //NO
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("<br>");

    document.write("TEST DIVIDING");
    document.write("<br>");
    var a = x / y;
    document.write("a = x / y = 5 / '94' = " + a + " and type of a is " + typeof(a)); //number -> string -> number
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("x / s = " + x / s); //NO
    document.write("<br>"); 
    document.write("x / b = " + x / b); //5 * true = 5
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("y / s = " + y / s); //NO
    document.write("<br>");
    a = b / y;
    document.write("a = b / y = true / '94' = " + a + " and type of a is " + typeof(a)); //bool -> string -> number
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("s / b = " + s / b); //NO
    document.write("<br>");
  </script>
</html>

```

Prints:

	var x = 5; var y = '94'; var s = 'skjg'; var b = true;

	TEST ADDING

	x + y = 594
	x + s = 5skjg
	x + b = 5true
	y + s = 94skjg
	b + y = true94
	s + b = skjgtrue

	TEST MULTIPLYING
	a = x * y = 5 * '94' = 470 and type of a is number
	x * s = NaN
	x * b = 5
	y * s = NaN
	a = b * y = true * '94' = 94 and type of a is number
	s * b = NaN

	TEST DIVIDING
	a = x / y = 5 / '94' = 0.05319148936170213 and type of a is number
	x / s = NaN
	x / b = 5
	y / s = NaN
	a = b / y = true / '94' = 0.010638297872340425 and type of a is number
	s / b = NaN


Because this program gives some logical answers and denies some operations, I would conclude that
      JavaScript is between weakly and strongly typed. An untyped language would let all of these 
      operations happen and give non-sensical output. A strongly typed language would not let any of 
      these happen (there would be no coersion). A weakly typed language would coerce to give output that 
      makes sense. For the most part, this program behaves as a weakly typed language, but sometimes it 
      does not allow some operations, which is most of the strongly typed nature. Therefore, I would conclude 
      that JavaScript is between weakly and strongly typed.
