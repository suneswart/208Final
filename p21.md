### Phase 21: History of JavaScript
######Sample Question #18

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in a span of 10 days in May, 1995. Brendan Eich worked at Netscape at the time and now works at Mozilla. [[1]](https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript) JavaScript was created because developers realized that the web had to be more dynamic than it was. [[3]](http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch04.html) JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. Most modern browsers use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to compile the JavaScript line by line into byte code as each line is about to run. [[2]](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs98si/slides/overview.html) Many companies are looking to hire JavaScript programmers to do web application development jobs. It's the third most in-demand programming language of 2015. [[4]](http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/8-most-in-demand-programming-languages-of-2015/)
