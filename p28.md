### Phase 28: Dangling Else
######Sample Question #30

JavaScript avoids the dangling else pitfall by requiring braces for if-statements:

```js
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <script>

    var x = 1;
    var y = 2;

    if(x > 0) {if(y<0){
    
       document.write("inside if");
       document.write("<br>");

    }else {

       document.write("inside else");
       document.write("<br>");}}
    
    
    
  </script>
</html>

```

Prints:

	inside else


The code without the braces would not run. It gave an error that said there are tokens expected. [[1]](http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch13.html#loops_conditionals_bodies)
