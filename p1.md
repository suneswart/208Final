### Phase 1: Hello World

This is "Hello World!" in JavaScript without using innerHTML. [1]

```js
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
	<script>
		document.write("Hello World!");
	</script>
</html>

```
This code simply prints: Hello World!\n
To run this code and the rest of the code in this report, simply save the code 
as an HTML executable file and open it in a web browser.
