### Phase 22: Implicitly vs Explicitly Typed

JavaScript is very obviously implicitly typed. Every data type is declared the same way, all using the "var" keyword:

```js
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <script>

    var x = 3;
    var y = "hello";
    var z = [1,2,3];
    var g = true;
    var t = 5.3;
    var r = 'd';

  </script>
</html>

```

>Prints nothing.
