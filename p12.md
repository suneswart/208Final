### Phase 12: Scope

To determine whether JavaSript has static or dynamic scope, I wrote the 
following program:

```js
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <script>

    var x = 9;

    addOne();

    function addOne() {
        x++;
    }

    document.write(x);
    document.write("<br>");

    doStuff();

    function doStuff(){
        x = "hi";
    }

    document.write(x);
    document.write("<br>");

  </script>
</html>

```

Prints:

	10
	hi


This shows that JavaScript has a dynamic scope. If it had a static scope then 
it would print:

        9
   	9


and it would say that x is not defined in addOne().
