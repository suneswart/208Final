### Phase 5: Static vs Dynamic Typing

To determine whether JavaScript is statically or dynamically typed I wrote the following short code:

```js

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <script>
	var x = "string";
    	document.write("Type of x is ", typeof x);
    	document.write("<br>");
    	x = 9;
    	document.write("Type of x is ", typeof x);
    	document.write("<br>");

    	// Test for duck typing
    	var monkey = {
            jump: function(){
              	  document.write("Jumps 20 feet");
              	  document.write("<br>");
            }
    	};

    	var turtle = {
            jump: function(){
            	  document.write("Jumps 0 feet");
              	  document.write("<br>");
            }
    	};

    	function jumper(animal){
        	 animal.jump();
        }

    	jumper(monkey);
    	jumper(turtle);
  </script>
</html>

```

Prints:

	Type of x is string
	Type of x is number
	Jumps 20 feet
	Jumps 0 feet

From the tests above I conclude that JavaScript is statically typed and 
duck typed, like python.
