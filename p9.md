### Phase 9: Deep vs Shallow Copying

To determine whether JavaScript uses deep copying of shallow copying of 
objects, I wrote the following code:

```js
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <script>
    "use strict";
    
    class Potato{
        constructor(i, s, ai, as){
            this.i = i;
            this.s = s;
            this.ai = ai;
            this.as = as;
        }
    }

    function change(something){
        something.i = 6;
        something.s = "hello";
        something.ai[2] = 9;
        something.as[2] = "no";
    }

    var p = new Potato(5, "hi", [1,2,3,4], ["hi", "bye", "bye"]);

    change(p);

    document.write(p.i);
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write(p.s);
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write(p.ai);
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write(p.as);
    document.write("<br>");
    
  </script>
</html>

```

Prints:

	6
	hello
	1,2,9,4
	hi,bye,no

This shows that JavaScript uses shallow copying. If our varible p was
deep copied, this program would have printed:

     5
     hi
     1,2,3,4
     hi,bye,bye

because the function change would have made copies for itself and would only have changed the values to use in it's own scope.
