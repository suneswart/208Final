### Phase 8: Static vs Dynamic Method Binding

To determine whether JavaScript has static or dynamic method binding, I wrote the following code:

```js 
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <script>
    "use strict";
    
    class Paint {
        kind() {
             this.printColor();
        }
        printColor(){
             document.write("no color");
             document.write("<br>");
        }
    }

    class RedPaint extends Paint{
        printColor(){
             document.write("red");
             document.write("<br>");
        }
    }

    var paint = new RedPaint();

    paint.printColor();
    paint.kind();
    
  </script>
</html>

```

Prints:
	
	red
	red

The code above allowed me to conclude that JavaScript has dynamic method 
binding. If it had static method binding it would have printed:
	 
	red
	no color
