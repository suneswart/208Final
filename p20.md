### Phase 20: Regular Expressions
######Sample Question #17

Regular Expressions are built into JavaScript and readily available to be used.
There are two main ways to create a regular expression in JavaScript.
Either declare it using slashes:

```js
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <script>

    var re = /12*4/;

  </script>
</html>

```

>Prints nothing.


Or call the constructor function:

```js
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <script>

    var re = new RegExp("12*4");

  </script>
</html>

```

>Prints nothing.

There are basic rules and shortcuts for patterns listed online by the developers. Here is a short example of how to use replace(), which only one of the six RegExp methods:

```js
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <script>

    var re = /(\w+)\s(\w+)/;
    var str = "First Last";
    var newStr = str.replace(re, "$2, $1");

    document.write(newStr);
    document.write("<br>");

  </script>
</html>


```


Prints:

	Last, First


This is only one example of the many useful functionalities of JavaScript regular expressions. [[12]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)
