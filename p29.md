### Phase 29: Precedence of Operators
######Sample Question #31

####Math Operators[[1]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)

The precedence is as follows: 
>Exponentiation > Multiplication > Division > Remainder > Addition > Subtraction


####Relational Operators[[1]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)

The precedence is as follows:
>Less Than > Less Than Or Equal	> Greater Than > Greater Than Or Equal > in > instanceof > Equality > Inequality > Strict Equality > Strict Inequality


####Bitwise Operators[[1]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)

The precedence is as follows:
>Bitwise Left Shift > Bitwise Right Shift > Bitwise Unsigned Right Shift > Bitwise AND > Bitwise XOR > Bitwise OR


####Logical[[1]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)

The precedence is as follows:
>Logical AND > Logical OR


####Extremes[[1]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)

>	The operator with the highest precedence of all: comma/sequence

>	The operator with the lowest precedence of all: grouping (parentheses)
