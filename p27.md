### Phase 27: Globals
######Sample Question #29

An interesting aspect of JavaScript globals is that any variable declared outside of a function is a global and any variably declared inside of a function WIHTOUT using the "var" keyword is automatically global. An automatically global variable can be used anywhere in the file AFTER the point where function that declared it was called. [[1]](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_scope.asp)

```js
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <script>

    var str = "str can print from anywhere"; //global
    document.write(str + " (outside of scope function)");
    document.write("<br>");
    //document.write(autoGlobal + " (outside of scope function)"); //ERROR
    //document.write("<br>");

    scope();
    
    function scope(){
        var notGlobal = "notGlobal only prints inside scope function";
        autoGlobal = "autoGlobal prints anywhere";
        document.write(str + " (inside of scope function)");
        document.write("<br>");
        document.write(autoGlobal + " (inside of scope function)");
        document.write("<br>");
        document.write(notGlobal + " (inside of scope function)");
        document.write("<br>");
        
    }
    
    document.write(autoGlobal + " (outside of scope function)");
    document.write("<br>");
    //document.write(notGlobal + " (outside of scope function)"); //ERROR
    //document.write("<br>");
    
    
  </script>
</html>

```

Prints:

	str can print from anywhere (outside of scope function)
	str can print from anywhere (inside of scope function)
	autoGlobal prints anywhere (inside of scope function)
	notGlobal only prints inside scope function (inside of scope function)
	autoGlobal prints anywhere (outside of scope function)
