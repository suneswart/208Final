### Phase 15: List Comprehension
######Sample Question #11

List comprehension is possibly in JavaScript, but is unfortunately not supported by all of the browsers. It is only supported by Firefox (Gecko). [[1]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Array_comprehensions)

Regardless, this is how one would go about doing array comprehension in JavaScript:

```js
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <script>

    numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
    doubles = [for (x of numbers) x*2]
    evens = [for (x of numbers) if (x % 2 == 0) x]

    document.write("doubles = " + doubles);
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("evens = " + evens);
    document.write("<br>");

  </script>
</html>

```

On a supported browser, this should print:

      doubles = 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20
      evens = 2,4,6,8,10
