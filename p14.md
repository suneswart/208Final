### Phase 14: Evaluation

The following program tests whether JavaScript uses strict or non-strict 
evaluation:

```js
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <script>

    function foo(x){
        document.write("running foo");
        document.write("<br>");
        return x;
    }

    function addOne(x, f) {
        return x+1;
    }

    var y = 143;
    var x = addOne(50, foo(y));

    document.write(x);
    document.write("<br>");

  </script>
</html>

```

Prints:

	running foo
	51

This shows that JavaScript uses strict evaluation. If it used non-strict it would not have ran foo() because foo was never called inside of the function addOne(), it was only a pararmeter.
