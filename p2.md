### Phase 2: Paradigm

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language; it is imperative, functional, and 
object-oriented. It is imperative because it reads and executed code from 
top to bottom. [2] It is a functional language because it can be used to write 
many different functions with or without names or parameters. It is also an 
object-oriented language because almost everything in JavaScript is an object.
Objects in JavaScript can do what classes do, it contains data, functions and 
more objects. [[2]](http://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-functional-javascript/) [[3]](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/dont-be-scared-of-functional-programming/)
